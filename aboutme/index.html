        </p>Hi! My name is Lizzie Cole, and I'm from Preston, Idaho. I am a freshman this year and I am still thinking about what I want to go into. I am taking this class to see if web designing could be a good career for me. I am excited to learn more about creating a website. 
         </p>I am the oldest in my family, with 3 sisters and 2 brothers. All of my siblings and I play a string instrument, which means we kind of have our own little orchestra. I also love to spend my time outdoors. Some of the activities that I like to do are backpacking, skiing, and wake surfing. 
        </p>One of my favorite scriptures is Doctrine and Covenants 19:23. It says, "Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me." I love this scripture because it shows that when we listen to the Lord's words, we can have peace in our lives.
