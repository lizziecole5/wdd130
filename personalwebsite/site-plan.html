      <h3>Tips to Improve (Page 3)</h3>
      <p>
        Nail the Basics:
        Good skiing starts with strong fundamentals. Keep your knees bent, weight centered, and practice balancing to stay in control. Building a solid foundation on easier trails helps you advance more quickly and confidently.
        Quick Tip: Focus on a low, balanced stance with hands forward to avoid leaning back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turn Like a Pro:
        Efficient turns make all the difference, especially on steeper slopes. Practice smooth, controlled S-turns by shifting your weight from one ski edge to the other. With time, turning will feel like second nature.
        Quick Tip: Use a gentle pole plant before each turn to keep rhythm and stay balanced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Build Confidence Gradually:
        Take on steeper slopes step-by-step. Start with trails that are a bit challenging but manageable, focusing on controlled turns and steady form. Progressing slowly helps build skill and reduces the chance of injury.
        Quick Tip: Visualize your line down the slope and take each section one turn at a time.
